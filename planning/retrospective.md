# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Avoid pushing the PRs without running the check-lists
- Stop naming branches without having agreed on a format

## Continue Doing

- Working as team
- Creating issues for every PR
- Creating a branch for every single issue

## Start Doing

- Always checking on which branch we are working on

## Lessons Learned

- We learned how to make a planning
- We learned to break down the code
- We learned to design a little bit

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- We were able to work everything that was described in the backlog
- We created issues for every feature implemented

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- The image's animation did not work out
- We failed to use a single convention for the names of the branches

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- No, we did not add anything extra.

### Or remove extra steps?

- No, we just needed to change the navigation bar position
